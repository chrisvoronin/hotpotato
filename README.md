- The more detail in the question, the better ChatGPT answer is.  For example "generate game screen in SwiftUI with background image and 2 buttons" will not be as good as "generate game screen in SwiftUI with background image, and 2 buttons centered on the screen, with first one titled "Play Game" and leads to SecondView, second button titled "How To Play" and leading to InstructionsView."
